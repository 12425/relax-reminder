Give eyes a breath

Popup a small count down window when you have been focused on the screen for a while.

This is inspired by [Workrave](https://workrave.org/) and written by pure [Autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/). The window has no fancy stuff, it's nothing but a progress bar.

We will see a micro break with a smaller window and a rest break with a wider one.
There's only an eye icon in the taskbar, no main window.
To hide the popup window, press `Right Ctrl`. To stop showing the window for an hour, press `Left Ctrl` + `Right Ctrl` when it shows.

The micro break shows when you keep using mouse or keyboard for 2 minutes. Idle time is not counted. The program doesn't track your eyeballs, so if there's no mouse or keyboard actions, it's also treated as idle.
The rest break shows after 10 minutes, and remind you to leave your screen for 45 seconds.

Do give your eyes a breath, frequently.
